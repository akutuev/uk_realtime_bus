# UK Realtime Bus

"UK Realtime bus" is a simple web appication which provides realtime bus information in UK. 
The source of data is public available API managed by Gov.UK bus data: https://data.bus-data.dft.gov.uk

The "UK Realtime Bus" application displays this data on map so users can observe available buses. Google maps doesn't provide such functions which is sometimes inconvinient when a bus is expected to come on time but doesn't appear.

Right now the functionality is pretty limited and aimed display buses only for a single provider which is "Oxford Bus Company and Thames Travel" because the main motivation was to manage personal schedule issues. Later, this is be improved and might cover a whole UK.
